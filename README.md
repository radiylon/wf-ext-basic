# Webflow Design Extension: Text Generator

This is a Webflow Designer Extension that helps you generate AI-powered text content directly in the Designer. Simply select a text element, enter your OpenAI API key, describe how you'd like to change the text, and the extension will use `gpt-4.1-nano` to generate and update the content in place. Features include:

- Text generation powered by OpenAI's chat completion models (gpt-4.1-nano)
- BYO API Key
- Support for updating any text element in the Designer
