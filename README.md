# Webflow Designer Extension + React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS Starter
This is a Webflow Designer Extension that helps you generate AI-powered text content directly in the Designer. Simply select a text element, enter your OpenAI API key, describe how you'd like to change the text, and the extension will use `gpt-4.1-nano` to generate and update the content in place.
